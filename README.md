# CNN Image Classifier

## Introduction
This project is focused on creating a Convolutional Neural Network model to predict the animal from an picture.

## Objectives
- Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  to classify images from a given dataset into predefined categories. 
- Implement a transfer learning approach using a pre-trained model. 
- Compare the performance of the custom CNN and the transfer learning model based on evaluation metrics and analysis.

## Result and Conclusions 
All the project is documented the `image_classificator_animals.ipynb` file.

A review of of the project at the presentation `CNNImageClasifier.pdf` including the answer to the initial questions, implementationd details, obstacles and conclusions.

## Dataset
- [Animals-10](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10/data) by [Corrado Alessio](https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99) \
